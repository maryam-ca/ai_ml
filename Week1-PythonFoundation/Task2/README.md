# Task 2 – Modular Python, Data Handling & Exceptions

This task focuses on building a strong Python foundation by writing clean, modular, and reusable code.  
All programs are written in separate Python files and cover file handling, exception handling, and basic data structures.

## 📄 File Details

### utils.py
This file contains reusable utility functions.  
It includes the use of *args, **kwargs, lambda functions, and simple helper logic that can be reused in other files.

### exception_handling.py
This file implements an exception-safe calculator.  
It handles common errors like invalid input and division by zero using try, except, else, and finally.

### contact_manager.py
This file is a file-based contact manager.  
It allows adding and viewing contacts using file handling (read, write, and append) and handles errors safely.

### student_records.py
This file implements a simple student record system.  
It uses lists and dictionaries to add, update, and display student records and also demonstrates modular imports.

### data_op.py
This file is for data manipulation practice.  
It includes removing duplicates, sorting data, and finding maximum, minimum, and average values using Python data structures.

## ▶ How to Run the Files

Make sure Python is installed on your system.  
Open terminal or command prompt in the Task2 folder and run any file using:

```bash
python filename.py
